# School District Analysis

## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to use Pandas to analyze a given data set to analyze the outcomes for standardized math and reading tests for grade nine to grade twelve students in a school district to provide insights about performance trends and pattern. 

In this analaysis the scores for grade 9s at Thomas High School have been ommitted due to evidence of academic dishonesty. We will be comparing the effect of this ommission to the results of the prior analysis.
